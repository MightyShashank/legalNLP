Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the said boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894, whereas learned counsel for the respondents contends that no plan has been annexed to the said lease and, therefore, the boundary could more satisfactorily and definitely be fixed with reference to the plans annexed to the subsequent lease deeds executed in favour of the successors in interest of the appellant and the respondents. The plaintiffs case was that as a result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable. The first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs ' coal land. The appellant gave evidence to show that the encroachment was prior to 1932, but there is no acceptable evidence on their part to establish that the respondents came to know of the removal of coal by the appellant or their possession of the coal removed beyond three years prior to the suit. The map, exhibit 3(b), annexed to the lease deed executed in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest clearly demarcates the boundary line between the holdings of the appellant and the respondents, and according to that plan the disputed extent falls within the boundary of the respondents ' holding. In other words, he has to prove that he obtained the knowledge of the defendant 's possession of the property within three years of the suit, and that is all. In Talyarkhan vs Gangadas (3), Rangnekar, J., formulated the legal position thus: \"The onus is on the plaintiff to prove that he first learnt within three years of the suit that the property which he is seeking to recover was in the possession of the defendant. If he proves this, then to succeed in the plea of limitation the defendant has to prove that the fact that the property was in his possession became known to the plaintiff more than three years prior to the suit.\n\" In paragraph 11 of the plaint, the plaintiffs allege that under the Indian Mines Act and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder the plaintiffs are bound to keep a barrier of 25 feet to the south of the defendant 's working and, therefore, the coal that is still left in the encroached area is not by any means accessible to the plaintiffs and being thus wholly unworkable is entirely lost to them for ever. But to say that no duty is cast upon the plaintiff even to allege the date when they had knowledge of the defendant 's possession of the converted property and that the entire burden is on the defendant is contrary to the tenor of the article in the Limitation Act and also to the rules of evidence. He held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land. But it does not prove that the respondents had knowledge of the fact that the appellant had encroached upon any portion of their coal mines. On June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal, that is, the predecessor in interest of the appellant demised a plot of 96 bighas carved out from his leasehold to Mathews under a deed exhibit C(1). The argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that the map translated into words indicates that the correct boundary should be a line drawn from the true meeting point of the four villages Pandebera, Jharia Khas, Lodhna and Kujama at a bearing of 82.15 ', whereas the contention of the respondents is that the line actually drawn on the lease map correctly lays down the northern boundary of the respondents ' leasehold. The appellant denied the said allegation and stated that the respondents all along knew and had been aware that the portion of coal land in question belonged to and was the property of the appellant. It is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants ' leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' lease hold. We accept the findings of the High Court that the respondents had knowledge of the appellant 's encroachment of their coal mines only in the year 1941 which was within three years of the date of the filing of the suit. The defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff , ' coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Abstractive Summary","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import PegasusTokenizer, PegasusForConditionalGeneration\nimport torch\n\n# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer\nmodel_path = \"/kaggle/input/legal-pegasus-summarizer/legal-pegasus-summarizer\"\n\ntokenizer_abstractive = PegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\nmodel_abstractive = PegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path).to(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n\ndef summarize(text, max_input_length=1024, max_output_length=256):\n    # Tokenize the input text\n    inputs = tokenizer_abstractive(\n        text,\n        max_length=max_input_length,\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\",\n        return_tensors=\"pt\"\n    )\n    \n    input_ids = inputs[\"input_ids\"].to(model_abstractive.device)\n    attention_mask = inputs[\"attention_mask\"].to(model_abstractive.device)\n\n    # Generate summary\n    summary_ids = model_abstractive.generate(\n        input_ids=input_ids,\n        attention_mask=attention_mask,\n        max_length=max_output_length,\n        num_beams=5, # Using beam search for better summaries\n        early_stopping=True\n    )\n\n    # Decode and return summary\n    summary = tokenizer_abstractive.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    return summary\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    generated_summary = summarize(extractive_summary)\n    print(\"Summary:\", generated_summary)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-28T11:38:00.115785Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-28T11:38:00.116556Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-28T11:38:22.557820Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-28T11:38:00.116532Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-28T11:38:22.556975Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Summary: According to the Indian Mines Act and the Indian Coal Mines Regulation, 1946, the respondents encroached upon the appellant 's coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.
